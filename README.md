# Password-Generator
## Bootcamp challenge #3: Use Javascript to complete a password generator

This is the third challenge in the Coding Bootcamp. We were provided with a skeleton website and had to create a random password generator with the following characteristics:

- prompt the user for the password length and validate that the answer is between 8 and 128 characters
- ask the user what types of characters they wish to be in the password: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters. For each character type, at least one representative will be in the password.
- the user must choose at least one character type (this is validated)
- the password of the desired length and according to the user-selected criteria, and displayed to the user.
- The password is sufficiently randomized using the [Fisher Yates method](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_sort.asp).

Below is a screenshot of the password generator.
